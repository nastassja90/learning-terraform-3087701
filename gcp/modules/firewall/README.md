# Custom firewall module

This Terraform module is an example that shows how to manually create a set of firewall rules on GCP, which are the equivalent of a security group with custom rules on AWS. This module has been created from scratch, starting from the minimal building blocks required as resources to define firewalls properly. In production when possible, it's better to use pre-made Terraform modules maintained by the community on the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/).

# Custom security group module

This Terraform module is an example that shows how to manually create a security group on AWS, along with custom rules definitions. This module has been created from scratch, starting from the minimal building blocks required as resources to define a security group properly. In production when possible, it's better to use pre-made Terraform modules maintained by the community on the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/).
